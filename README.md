#MovieInfo - Simple movie-library tool
------------------------
MovieInfo is a simple movie-library tool for retrieving movie information from
Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) and showing this info in neat and simple GUI.

Complete features:
- Retrieve movies from a given folder
- Parse folder names for making a query to OMDb
- Method for connecting to OMDb and passing folder name as movie name
- Parsing OMDb response & showing it in the client

Partially complete features:
- Make a first GUI.

TODO:
- Make interactive GUI so it works with OMDb
- Store fetched movie information in .xml or database and load info from there,
  instead of making query to OMDb every time.
